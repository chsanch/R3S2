r3s2 is the small-sized registration system for any-sized events. It's developed in Perl, under the Catalyst MVC Framework. It's based in the r3s project, this is the r3s reloaded ;) 
This is the very first version of the project.

 sudo aptitude install libdbix-class-encodedcolumn-perl libdbix-class-timestamp-perl
usar libcatalyst-modules-perl 0.37 por un problema con C::V::Email (usar version >=0.23)
